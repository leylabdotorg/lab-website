For many years, the Ley lab has studied the genomics, epigenomics, and molecular mechanisms that drive the blood cancer known as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Past accomplishments include:
 - establishing that the initiating event for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia is the PML-RARA fusion gene created by the t(15;17), found in nearly all patients with this disease. 
 - sequencing the first human human cancer genome (a patient with AML) and the first mouse cancer genome (from the mouse model of APL), in collaboration with the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University
 - Discovering recurrent initiating and cooperating mutations that are relevant for the pathogenesis of AML and outcomes, both through our own work, and through leadership of the TCGA AML study.
 - In collaboration with members of the Genomics of AML Project Program grant, establishing clinical genomic sequencing as the gold standard for AML patients.

Current projects include:
- Understanding the mechanisms that lead to AML initiation
- Studying the immune landscape of AML
- Applying new genomic technologies to 

Ultimately, our goal is to develop new prognostic tests and new approaches for the therapy of patients with AML.
